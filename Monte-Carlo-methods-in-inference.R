###   MONTE CARLO METHODS IN INFERENCE      ###
###############################################

# Monte Carlo Methods may refer to any method in
# statistical inference or numerical analysis 
# where simulation is used.

# Here we just look at inference.
# Can use MC to estimate parameters of sampling
# distribution of a statistic, mean squared 
# error (MSE), percentiles, or other measures 
# of interest.

# In statistical inference there is uncertainty
# in an estimate. The methods we are going to 
# look at now use repeated sampling from a 
# given probability model, known as parametric 
# bootstrap, to investigate.

# We simulate the stochastic process that 
# generated the data, repeatedly drawing 
# samples under identical conditions.

# Other MC methods known as nonparametric 
# use repeated sampling from an observed sample.

### MONTE CARLO METHODS FOR ESTIMATION

## Let's begin with simply estimating a 
## probability. Sometimes this is referred 
## to as computing an expectation of a 
## random variable.

## If you have a random variable X with 
## a density function f(x) and we want to 
## compute the expectation of a function h(x)
## which models the probability of f(X),
## (or the area under the curve of f(x)), 
## then h(x) can be expressed as the integral
## of f(x).

## Sam and Annie from 'Sleepless in Seattle'

## Let A and S represent Sam's and Annie's 
## arrival times at the Empire State Building, 
## where we measure the arrival time as the
## number of hours after noon.

## We assume A and S are independent and 
## uniformly distributed and that Annie 
## arrives somewhere between 10:30 and midnight
## and Sam arrives somewhere between 10:00 and
## 11:30PM.

## Our Questions are:
# 1) What is the probability that Annie 
#    arrives before Sam?
# 2) What is expected difference in arrival 
#    times?

## FIRST QUESTION
# We simulate a large number of values from 
# distribution of (A,S) say, 1000,
# where A and S are independent:

sam = runif(1000, 10, 11.5)
annie = runif(1000, 10.5, 12)

# We want the probability P(A < S) which is 
# estimated by the proportion of simulated 
# pairs (a,s) where a is smaller than s

prob = sum(annie < sam) / 1000 # sum() is vectorized
prob

# [1] 0.224
# Estimated probability that Annie arrives 
# before Sam is 0.224

# shaded region shows area A < S

plot(sam,annie)
polygon(c(10.5, 11.5, 11.5, 10.5),
        c(10.5, 10.5, 11.5, 10.5), density = 10, angle = 135)

# standard error of this estimate is
sqrt(prob * (1 - prob) / 1000)
# [1] 0.01318423

## ESTIMATING AN EXPECTATION: Question #2
# What is the expected difference in the arrival 
# times?

# Annie more likely to arrive later, so we 
# model E(A-S)
difference = annie - sam

# Monte Carlo estimate is mean of these 
# differences
mc.est = mean(difference)
mc.est
# [1] 0.485206

# Estimated standard error is sd of diffs 
# divided by
# square root of simulation sample size:
se.est = sd(difference) / sqrt(1000)
c(mc.est, se.est)
# [1] 0.4852060 0.0194314

# So we estimate that Annie will arrive 0.485 
# hours after Sam arrives. Since standard error 
# is only 0.02 hours, we can be 95% confident 
# that the true difference is within 0.04 hours 
# of this estimate

#### GENERAL CASE WITH
#### STANDARD NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS

# Suppose the X1, X2 are iid from a standard 
# normal distribution. We want to estimate 
# the mean difference E|X1 - X2| (expected 
# value of absolute difference)

### Example of Basic Monte Carlo estimation

# This one is easy. We generate a large number 
# of random samples of size 2 from a standard 
# normal distribution, then compute the 
# replicate pairs' mean differences, and then
# the mean of those differences.

m <- 1000
g <- numeric(m)
for (i in 1:m) {
  x <- rnorm(2)
  g[i] <- abs(x[1] - x[2])
}
est <- mean(g)
est

# [1] 1.098206
# this time we got 1.0982
# second time got 1.142562

# can prove by integration that it equals 
# 2/sqrt(pi) or 1.128379 and that the 
# variance is 2-4/(pi) and the standard
# error of the estimate is

sqrt(sum((g - mean(g))^2)) / m

# or [1] 0.02709247 is this example

### Example of Estimating the MSE of 
### a trimmed mean

# A trimmed mean can be used to estimate the 
# center of a continuous symmetric distribution 
# that is not normal

# You get a trimmed mean by averaging all but 
# the largest and smallest sample observations.

# Here the center is 0, we implement by writing 
# a for loop (could also use replicate() 
# function)

n <- 20   # vector is 20 long
m <- 1000 # go for 1000 replications
tmean <- numeric(m) # initialize numeric vector of 1000
for (i in 1:m) {  # loop through 1000 times
  x <- sort(rnorm(n)) # sort n is vector of 20
  tmean[i] <- sum(x[2:(n-1)]) / (n-2) # trim off 
}                                     # first & last
mse <- mean(tmean^2) # determine mse
mse
sqrt(sum((tmean - mean(tmean))^2)) / m    #se

# [1] 0.04978369 here mse is 0.049

# true mse Var(X)/n = 1/20 or 0.05 here

# standard error (est) is [1] 0.007055548

### Estimate MSE of trimmed median

# actually, median is a trimmed mean
# So here we repeat for the median

n <- 20
m <- 1000
tmean <- numeric(m)
for (i in 1:m) {
  x <- sort(rnorm(n))
  tmean[i] <- median(x) # only difference in this line
}
mse <- mean(tmean^2)
mse
sqrt(sum((tmean - mean(tmean))^2)) / m    #se

# here [1] 0.07411576 is median (est)

# and standard error (est) [1] 0.008608699

##### ESTIMATING A CONFIDENCE LEVEL

# Often need evaluate cdf of sampling distribution
# of a statistic, when density function is unknown.

# For example, often assume that sampled population
# is normally distributed. If population non-normal,
# true distribution of the estimator may be unknown.

# This is a problem of integration, when you can
# generate the distribution g(X) but the true
# function g(x) is unknown.

### Example of Confidence interval for variance

# Consider confidence interval for variance, is
# sensitive to mild departures from normality. Can
# use MC methods to estimate true confidence level
# when normal theory confidence interval for variance
# is applied to non-normal data.

# Here we calculate 95% Upper Confidence Limit (UCL)
# for random sample size n=20 from a n(0, var=4)
# distribution (sigma-squared is 4 in this case)

n <- 20      # sample size
alpha <- .05  # alpha when want 95% UCL
x <- rnorm(n, mean=0, sd=2) # normal, variance = 4
# qchisq() is quantile function for chi-sq dist w/ df
(UCL <- (n-1) * var(x) / qchisq(alpha, df=n-1))

# Do it several times, Upper Confidence Limit
# (UCL) all contain sigma-squared = 4

# If we do this large number of times, approximately
# 95% of the intervals should contain sigma-squared
# (=4) assuming sampled population is normal with a
# variance sigma-squared.

### Example of MC estimate of confidence level

# Simulation experiment: Repeat large number of times,
# compute the proportion of intervals that contain
# the target parameter

n <- 20
alpha <- .05
UCL <- replicate(1000, expr = { # we do above 1000 times
  x <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 2)
  (n-1) * var(x) / qchisq(alpha, df = n-1)
} )
# count the number of intervals that contain sigma^2=4
sum(UCL > 4)

# [1] 949

#or compute the mean to get the confidence level
mean(UCL > 4)

# [1] 0.949

# result is that 949 intervals satisfied (UCL > 4) so
# empirical confidence level is 94.9%, very close to
# theoretical value of 95%.

# Can show that standard error of the estimate
# at 95% UCL is exactly 0.00689

# Could also accomplish call above like this

# Use calcCI as function without replicate
calcCI <- function(n, alpha0) { # as a function
  y <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 2)
  return((n-1) * var(y) / qchisq(alpha, df = n-1))
} 

# put relicate, n, alpha here where call the function
UCL <- replicate(1000, expr = calcCI(n=20, alpha = .05))

# count the number of intervals that contain sigma^2=4
sum(UCL > 4)
mean(UCL > 4)

### Example of Empirical confidence level

# What happens is sampled population is non-normal?
# Suppose have sampled pop of chi-Sq(2) which has a
# variance of 4, but is distinctly non-normal.

# We simply repeat the simulation, replacing N(0,4)
# samples with Chi-Sq(2) samples

n <- 20
alpha <- .05
UCL <- replicate(1000, expr = {
  x <- rchisq(n, df = 2) # do not use rnorm() to sample
  (n-1) * var(x) / qchisq(alpha, df = n-1)
} )
sum(UCL > 4)
# [1] 794
mean(UCL > 4)
# [1] 0.794

# In this experiment, only 794 of the intervals contained
# the population variance, which is far less than the 95%
# coverage under normality.

## NOTE: all examples above are 'parametric' in sense that
## distribution of sampled population is specified. MC
## approach here is called 'parametric bootstrap'

## Is in contrast to the 'ordinary bootstrap' where samples
## are generated from observed samples where distribution 
## is NOT specified, is sometimes called 'non-parametric'
## and includes bootstrapping and jackknifing, which can
## also be used to estimate the bias and the standard
## error of an estimate.

## MORE ON SIMULATING SAMPLING DISTRIBUTION WITH MC
# Suppose observe a random sample y1,...,yn
# from exponential density function with unknown
# location parameter theta and you only observe
# sample median M

# simulate median for exponential function
sim.median = function(n)
  median(rexp(n))

# replicate 10000 times for a sample size of 21
M = replicate(10000, sim.median(21))

# draw histogram, use prob=TRUE so vertical
# axis is probability density function
hist(M, prob=TRUE, main="")

# to confirm simulated draws are from
# sampling density of M, we define samp.med()
# to compute exact density
samp.med = function(m, n){
  con = factorial(n) / factorial((n - 1) / 2)^2
  con * pexp(m)^((n - 1) / 2) * (1 - pexp(m))^((n - 1) / 2) * dexp(m)
}

# then use curve to overlay exact density on
# histogram of simulated sample, is a good fit
curve(samp.med(x, 21), add=TRUE, col="red")

## CONSTRUCTING A PERCENTILE CONF INTERVAL
# Suppose observe a random sample y1,...,yn
# from exponential density function with unknown
# location parameter theta and you only observe
# sample median M

# compute quantile for 90% CI
# in between %5 and 95%
quantile(M, c(0.05, 0.95))

#         5%       95% 
#  0.4011316 1.1062898 

# So 90% CI is (M-1.1062898,M-0.4011316)

# to illustrate using this CI, suppose we collect
# the following 31 exponential observations 
# stored in vector y (data is collected from
# exponential distribution with theta = 4.5)
y = c(6.11, 5.04, 4.83, 4.89, 4.97, 5.15, 7.98, 4.62,
      6.19, 4.58, 6.34, 4.54, 6.37, 5.64, 4.53, 4.68,
      5.17, 4.72, 5.06, 4.96, 4.70)

# what is the median?:
median(y)

# width of CI
c(median(y) - 1.1062898, median(y) - 0.4011316)

# actual value of theta is 4.5. If we repeated
# this procedure a large number of times, we
# would find that approximately 90% of the
# intervals would cover theta

## COMPARING ESTIMATORS: THE TAXI PROBLEM
# a person is wandering the streets of a city
# and notices the following numbers of 5 taxis
# that pass by: 34,100,65,81,120

# Can she make an intelligent guess at the number
# of taxis in the city?: Is a problem of statistical
# inference where population is collection of
# taxis driven in city and one wishes to know
# unknown number of taxis N

# Assume taxis are numbered 1 to N, each equally
# likely to be observed

# Consider two possible estimates: (1) the 
# largest taxi number observed; and (2) twice the
# sample mean. 

# Which is a better estimate of the number of
# taxis N?

# We compare these two estimators using a sim

# Simulate taxi numbers from a uniform dist
# with a known number of taxis N and compute
# the two estimates. Repeat many times and
# obtain two empirical sampling distributions.

# Then can compare the two estimators by 
# examining various properties of their respective
# sampling distributions

# taxi() function implements a single simulation.
# Two arguments: actual number of taxis N and
# sample size n. sample() function simulates 
# observed taxi numbers and values of the two
# estimates are stored in variables estimate1
# and estimate2.

taxi = function(N, n){
  y = sample(N, size=n, replace=TRUE)
  estimate1 = max(y)
  estimate2 = 2 * mean(y)
  c(estimate1=estimate1, estimate2=estimate2)
}

# Let's say actual number of taxis in city is 100
# and we observe numbers of n=5 taxis.
taxi(100, 5) # get values N1=95 N2=82.8

# Let's simulate sampling process 1000 times
EST = replicate(1000, taxi(100, 5))
str(EST) # matrix 2 rows (N1 and N2), 1000 cols
         # columns hold estimated values of N1
         # for 1000 simulated experiments.

## ESTIMATING BIAS

# Want "unbiasedness" which means average value
# of estimator will be equal to parameter.

# we know number of taxis to be 100 and know std err

# Here we estimate their bias and standard errors
c(mean(EST["estimate1", ]) -100, sd(EST["estimate1", ]) / sqrt(1000))
# [1] -16.3880000   0.4522433 # negative bias
c(mean(EST["estimate2", ]) -100, sd(EST["estimate2", ]) / sqrt(1000))
# [1] 1.3484000 0.8259659 # positive bias

# appears N2 is "less biased" but we can also
# compare them with respect to the mean distance
# from the parameter N (mean absolute error)

## ESTIMATING MEAN DISTANCE FROM TARGET
# Compute mean absolute error and draw boxplot
absolute.error = abs(EST - 100)
boxplot(t(absolute.error)) # N1=max(y) has smaller
                           # estimation errors

# Use apply() to find sample mean of the absolute
# errors, by estimating mean distance D
apply(t(absolute.error), 2, mean)
# estimate1 estimate2
#   16.3880   20.8476 # estimate1 better again 

# We can also use apply() to compute simulation
# standard error of these estimates
apply(t(absolute.error), 2, sd) / sqrt(1000)
# estimate1 estimate2
# 0.4522433 0.4989812 # estimate1 better again
                      # has smaller mean absolute
                      # error
